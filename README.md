# Potolin_Perceptron
A CS346 Intelligent Systems 2 assignment.
This project aims to implement a simple NOR logic gate using perceptron algorithm.

Findings:
The model will successfully learn to compute for the NOR gate iff the bias is set to 0 and initial learning rate is not greater that 1.5 but not less than or equal0.
